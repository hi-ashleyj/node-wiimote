-- 0.2.0: THE 'EVENTS AND ERRORS UPDATE'

Errors are now programatic and may not print to console.
Critical errors now throw catchable errors.
Non critical errors return error objects (and may catch exceptions themselves).
Warnings print to console.

Overhaul of the way events are stored and triggered, ready for 0.3 and 0.4

Callbacks now get event objects, for dealing with multiple buttons on a single callback (but might still need to tell them apart)
Support removing event listeners with the names of events or actions

Add getting list of all events (hopefully not needed but could be passed through to users through GUI)

Fixed bug where errors were thrown when wiimote disconnects. Aka I was using it to control a lighting rig then everything crashed and burned so I fixed it.

Updated docs, changelong, todo, readme
Updated node-hid and removed (now) unused colors

-- 0.1.0: 'THE FIX EVERYTHING UPDATE'
Created Git Repo! Yay!
Added built in documentation that is more lengthy.
Added new TODO.txt for todo notes and stuff
Added new message for unknown data reports

Changed vibrate() to accept a number, to allow vibration for a length of time.
	vibrate() still accepts boolean values by design, and is backwards compatible
Changed temporary description to something a bit more permanent
Changed init behavior, has variable instance.exists which contains that data

Fixed missing require("colors")
Fixed possible bug where plugging in an expansion device could prevent further reporting

Removed unused dependecies from package.json
